# char_counter
Count, filter, order and print a line based on a string line

I'm learning ruby and i found a challenge where i have to take a string line. This line have characters on upper and lower case.

-> Order the characters by cuantity.
-> If some characters have the same count value, order those character by alphabetic position.
-> Do not repeate any character.
